            <h1>Why Donate?</h1>
            <p>Many people require bone marrow transplants for diseases including but not limited to leukemia. Thousands of people are diagnosed with these diseases every year, and bone marrow donors greatly increase their chances for living a normal life. The majority of these patients will not find a suitable donor within their family, so it is very important that other people register with organizations to be matched with a patient.</p>
            <p>According to the American Cancer Society, one in 285 kids will be diagnosed with childhood cancer before age 20.  Childhood cancer is not just one disease but made up of 12 major types with over 100 subtypes, with survival rates from 97% for Hodgkin Lymphoma to less than 1% for DIPG.  The ultimate treatment for the patient is a bone marrow transplant.  In the USA, 77% of White Americans can find matching donors, but only 40% of Asian Americans and 25% of African Americans can find matching donors.  So we need to encourage more minorities to register as marrow donors.  Registering as a marrow donor is easy: simply swab your cheek and mail back the saliva sample. No need to draw blood or send in your skin sample. Registering as marrow donors are free for adults between 18 and 44.</p>

            <h1>About this website</h1>
            <p>This website was created and designed by a group of teenagers, who were motivated by the need for bone marrow donors in their immediate community. The double leukemia diagnosis for two siblings in one family during the pandemic revealed the need for Asian American donors.</p>
