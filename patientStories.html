            <h2>Jerry's Story</h2>
            <p>According to the American Cancer Society, one in 285 kids will be diagnosed with childhood cancer before age 20.  Childhood cancer is not just one disease but made up of 12 major types with over 100 subtypes, with survival rates from 97% for Hodgkin Lymphoma to less than 1% for DIPG.  The ultimate treatment for the patient is a bone marrow transplant.  In the USA, 77% of White Americans can find matching donors, but only 40% of Asian Americans and 25% of African Americans can find matching donors.  So we need to encourage more minorities to register as marrow donors.  Registering as a marrow donor is easy: simply swab your cheek and mail back the saliva sample. No need to draw blood or send in your skin sample. Registering as marrow donors are free for adults between 18 and 44. <br>

                Our son Jerry was diagnosed with high-risk leukemia AML in 2012, and he has had two bone marrow transplants. But like most (about two-thirds) patients, Jerry has suffered from many GVHD post-transplant diseases such as kidney failure, vision impairment, immune system compromise, heart issues, and growth issues. As a result, he has never been able to physically attend school and has been on nightly renal dialysis for over four years now. <br>
                
                Thanks to Alliance for Childhood Cancer and Leukemia and Lymphoma Society for their effort in asking for help from many Senators and House representatives in the Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus to pass and support the STAR Act (CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORSHIP, TREATMENT, ACCESS AND RESEARCH).  The Act has focused on the physical, financial, medical, and emotional needs of all those families with cancer kids.  No child and no family should fight cancer alone!<br>

            <h2>Yang family – Jerry & Lillian</h2>
            <p>Lillian Yang, a 7-year-old Chinese girl, seemed like a healthy little girl until she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in September 2020 after experiencing paleness and red spots, which are symptoms of low platelet count. A skin biopsy revealed that a genetic mutation caused Lillian and her older brother Jerry to be predisposed to AML. Lillian went through four rounds of chemotherapy, but the best cure for AML was a bone marrow transplant. Unfortunately, because patients are most likely to have a bone marrow match with someone of the same ethnicity and there are few Chinese donors, Lillian only had a 43% chance of finding a match. Additionally, there were other obstacles, such as the COVID-19 pandemic closing Chinese and Taiwanese registries and the lack of U.S. matches. Yet through all the struggle, Lillian still smiled. She told jokes to her doctors and nurses and dreamed of being a hospital volunteer to help children. Her dad believed that she was the most popular patient on the hospital floor because she was always so happy and lively. </p>

            <h2>Xie family</h2>
            <p>Family Affect: (By Lois Xie)
                My dad was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome in March of 2020. He had to live near the University of Kansas Hospital–a forty-five minute drive away– to attend his procedures. He received heart and lung checkups as well as transplant evaluations.
                Initially, the biggest change was his weakened immune system. We had to stay home so we wouldn’t be exposed to something that would get him sick. Due to COVID-19, everyone had to stay home, so our lives were not completely different from everyone else’s.
                My mom accompanied him when he moved, so my sisters and I lived by ourselves. Our family conquered this battle with the help of our community. They showed us kindness: our neighbor mowed the lawn and people from church sent us meals regularly. Although the donor saved my dad’s life, our community comforted and cared for us during our difficult time.
                Even though my dad has experienced graft versus host disease after his transplant, our family continues to support him and we hope he completely recovers.
            </p>
            <p>Dad Statement:
                In March of 2020, during my annual checkup, we found that my white, red blood cells and platelets counts had dropped to a dangerous range. After a bone marrow biopsy, we discovered a problem with my stem cells: they were not working. This prevented blood cells and platelets from being produced. I was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The best treatment was a bone marrow transplant. Therefore, we had to find a suitable donor. The hospital found a donor for me by using a national blood bank. As I was awaiting the transfer, I had to go through chemotherapy to prepare my body.
                The donor gave me healthy stem cells that I did not have, rebuilding my immune system. I am very lucky to be able to find a compatible donor quickly. Blood banks with a variety of blood types are essential to this process. My donor saved my life.
