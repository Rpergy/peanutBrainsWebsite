            <h1>About the Donation Process</h1>
            <button class = "accordion">About marrow donor registries</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Because only 30 percent of patients needing a transplant find a match among family members, 70 percent of patients must rely on volunteer bone marrow and blood stem cell donors who have joined one of the worldwide donor registries. Gift of Life is one of two public registries in the United States, and is a member of the World Marrow Donor Association (WMDA). </p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Age matters!</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>While anyone between 18 and 40 can join the registry, the most frequently requested donors are young and male. Young people produce more stem cells, and due to their larger physical size, men produce more stem cells. The most requested donor group is 18 to 35, yet all donors can remain in the registry until their 61st birthday, and plenty of donors are called from the 36 to 40 group! Gift of Life actively encourages young people to join the registry through several educational programs, including the Campus Ambassador Program for college students and Senior Swabbers for high schools students.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">The Confirmatory Typing process</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>The prospective donor is asked for a blood draw that is sent to a laboratory for an in-depth HLA analysis to find out exactly how closely the potential donor's human leukocyte antigens — key factors in the immune system — match up with the recipient’s tissue type. A match may be a partial or a perfect match. At the same time, tests for infectious diseases are conducted.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">The importance of commitment</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>The Confirmatory Typing (CT) team will counsel the prospective donor about the donation process, and ensure that the donor is fully committed to the donation. This commitment is important, because once the donation is scheduled, the recipient undergoes rigorous treatments to clear their body of diseased blood cells, including chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. This completely depletes their immune system and their own bone marrow, meaning they are no longer capable of producing blood cells on their own. At that point, if the transplant does not happen, the patient will not survive.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">The Work Up process</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Once the donor has committed to the donation, the Work Up Coordinator will arrange the donation. Whether the donation will be peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow, everything must be set in motion so that the transplant occurs exactly when the patient is ready. The Work Up team will arrange for the donor to have a physical exam as well as any required transplant preparation, such as injections of Neupogen to stimulate stem cell production.<br>
                    The Work Up team also makes travel arrangements, if needed. A representative from Gift of Life will be present throughout the donation process, ensuring that the donor has everything needed – such as food, transportation and moral support. Gift of Life does everything possible to make donation a seamless process for the donor and his or her family.
                </p>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Donating peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs)</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Approximately 80 percent of hematopoietic stem cell transplants in the United States are done through PBSC collection. Donors providing PBSCs must be prepared for several days in advance – a daily injection is given to stimulate the stem cells to move out of the marrow and into the blood stream. The first injection is given at a clinic, and following injections are done by a visiting nurse at the donor’s home.<br>
                    At the donation center the donor’s blood is drawn from one arm to pass through an apheresis machine, and is then returned into the other arm. Inside the machine, the blood is separated into its components and the stem cells only are separated out and collected. The process may take several hours, and it is important for the donor to eat soon after donation. A Gift of Life representative is always there help to ensure that every donor is well taken care of!

            <button class = "accordion">Recovery from donating PBSCs</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Stems cells regenerate naturally, so donors providing PBSCs normally feel fully recovered in 24 to 36 hours.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Donating bone marrow</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Approximately 20 percent of hematopoietic stem cell transplants in the United States are done through bone marrow collection, which is most often requested for pediatric patients. Those donating bone marrow will have a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Marrow is drawn from the largest bone in the body, the hip bone, specifically from the iliac crest – easily found by putting your hands on your hips with thumbs forward and fingers towards your back. The iliac crest is the ridge you can feel under your fingers on each side.<br>
                    Marrow is extracted from both sides at the same time to speed up the process. Doctors use a special syringe to draw the marrow out of the bone. The process is normally completed in under two hours.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Recovery after marrow donation</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Recovery can take several days, as the bone marrow naturally regenerates. Donors often report their back is sore for anywhere from one to three days afterwards, treatable with over the counter pain relievers. Most return to work within one to two days, and usually return to normal levels of exercise within a week or ten days, depending on how fast the marrow regenerates.</p>

            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <button class = "accordion">How do people become donors?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Volunteer donors can join the Gift of Life registry either at a donor drive, or by requesting a swabbing kit on our website or by calling 800-9MARROW.<br>
                    Many people join registries at recruitment drives. Most drives today use swabbing kits, which use cells collected on a giant cotton swab from the inside of the cheek. The swabs are packaged and sent to a lab for tissue typing to determine the HLA markers. Once the tissue type is determined, that information is entered in the registry and made available for worldwide searches by transplant centers and physicians.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">What happens when a donor is identified as a match?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>When a donor comes up in the database as a match, the registry he or she joined is contacted by the transplant center, and asked to call the donor in for Confirmatory Typing.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">What happens to the donation?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Once the bone marrow or blood stem cells are collected and prepared, they are carried in cooled containers by a courier to the transplant center where the recipient will receive his or her transplant. The package never leaves the courier’s hands, and qualifies for a special customs clearance if the transplant center is overseas.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Why was the donation delayed?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Everything in the donation process is designed to ensure that the patient is fully prepared to receive the transplant so he or she will have the best chance of recovery. Sometimes delays occur due to the patient needing more time in the preparation process. A Work Up Coordinator will keep every donor informed as much as possible.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Why can’t I donate? Will I be able to in the future?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Part of the donation process involves a thorough review of any past illnesses or current conditions that may prevent you from donating. Some of these have to do with protecting the donor's health, and most are designed to protect the recipient. Many people who cannot donate bone marrow due to back or hip injuries or conditions may still donate peripheral blood stem cells.<br>
                    Anyone with a temporary condition that prevents them from donating now may be able to donate in the future. This donor's status will be put on hold until a determination is made that he or shee can reenter the registry.<br>
                    Pregnant women may not donate while pregnant, due to the production of antibodies that can cause rejection of the transplant (Graft-Versus-Host disease). Three months after delivery of the child, women may once again donate bone marrow and peripheral stem cells.<br>
                    If a prospective donor is called but later on the donation is cancelled, it is possible that several matches were available and another donor was selected for transplant. The donation coordinator will share available information where possible, but details may not be available from the transplant center.<br>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">How is a bone marrow match determined?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Doctors look for a donor who matches their patient's tissue type, specifically their human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type. HLAs are proteins — or markers — found on most cells in your body. Your immune system uses these markers to recognize which cells belong in your body and which do not. The closer the match between the patient's HLA markers and yours, the better for the patient.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">How likely is it that I will match a patient and go on to donate?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Because of the vast variation in tissue types, we can't predict an individual registry member's chance of donating to a patient. If you have a relatively common tissue type, you might be one of many who could match a searching patient. If you have an uncommon tissue type, you may never match a patient, or you might be the only one out of more than 39 million potential donors on the registry who can save a person's life. Every person who joins the registry gives patients more hope of finding the match they need. The most important thing you can do as a registry member is to stay informed and committed so that if you're selected as the best donor, you're ready to move forward.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">What happens if I match a patient?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p> More testing will be done to see if you are the best possible match for the patient. We may ask for another cheek swab or blood sample or we may be able to use a stored sample. Though almost all patient information is confidential, we can tell you the patient's age, gender and disease. If the patient's doctor selects you as the best donor for the patient, we will schedule an information session so you can learn more about the donation process, risks and side effects. At that time, we can also tell you the type of donation the patient's doctor has requested — either bone marrow or cells collected from the blood, (PBSC) donation.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Who pays for the donation process?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Donors never pay for donating, and are never paid to donate. All medical costs for the donation procedure are covered by the National Marrow Donor Program® (NMDP), which operates the Be The Match Registry®, or by the patient's medical insurance, as are travel expenses and other non-medical costs. The only costs to the donor might be time taken off from work.</p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">What is the bone marrow donation process like?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Marrow donation is a surgical procedure that takes place in an operating room. The donation will be scheduled at a hospital that partners with the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). In some cases, the hospital may be near your home. In other cases, you may be asked to travel. We will guide you through the process and be available the day of your marrow donation.<br>
                    Hospital Stay: You will arrive at the hospital outpatient facility on the day of the donation. You will stay in the hospital usually from early morning to late afternoon, though some hospitals routinely plan for an overnight hospital stay.<br>
                    Anesthesia: You will be given anesthesia to block the pain during the marrow donation. If general anesthesia is used, you will be unconscious during the donation. If you receive regional anesthesia (either spinal or epidural), medication will block sensation in the affected area, but you will remain aware of your surroundings. General anesthesia is used for about 96% of NMDP marrow donors. The average time of anesthesia is less than 2 hours. .<br>
                    Donation: During the marrow donation, you will be lying on your stomach. While the donation varies slightly from hospital to hospital, generally, the doctors use special, hollow needles to withdraw liquid marrow (where blood-forming cells are made) from both sides of the back of the pelvic bone. The incisions are less than one-fourth inch long and do not require stitches.<br>
                    Recovery: Hospital staff will watch you closely until the anesthesia wears off, and continue to monitor your condition afterwards. Most donors go home the same day or the next morning. After you leave the hospital, we will contact you on a regular basis to ask about your physical condition and any side effects you are experiencing.<br>
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3></h3>

            <button class = "accordion">Does donating PBSC hurt? Are there side effects?</button>
            <div class = "panel">
                <p>Donors may experience headaches or bone and muscle pain, similar to a cold or the flu, for several days before collection. These are side effects of the filgrastim injections that disappear shortly after donation. Other common side effects are nausea, trouble sleeping and tiredness. Less than one percent (0.6%) of donors experience serious side effects from filgrastim. The PBSC donation procedure can also have side effects. Some donors experience tingling around the mouth, fingers and toes and mild muscle cramps. This is caused by the anti-coagulant (blood thinner) used in the apheresis procedure. These symptoms are easily treated with calcium replacement or by slowing down the procedure. Other common side effects include bruising at the needle site, chills and a decrease in the blood platelet count.</p>
